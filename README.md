### Navbar (Component)

- The Navbar component ensures seamless navigation across the site, with active page highlighting for enhanced user experience.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS/ReactBootStrap
- JavaScript / React / ReactRouter
- Tsparticles
- FramerMotion
- Figma

## Design

- The design for the website was kept somewhat simple so that the navigation of the site for users wouldn't become overly cumbersome and involve to many moving parts. Because of this we decided that it was best to make the site a single application where the navbar would always remain the saim and highlight to users where they currently were on the site.
- Purple was chosen as the primary colour of the site as this was Miss Sapphy Doyle's favourite colour and we thought it would be a way of getting a little but of herself across.
- The background was made using Tsparticles. This allowed to add a more dynamic feel while not being overly distracting to people using the site. To further make sure this was the case the default settings which had mouse movement and clicks interact with the background were removed.
  - As with the colour scheme for the navbar purples were used for the particles in the background, in particular a range of purples were included in an array to be chosen to give a little variance and make the background more interesting. A singular white was used to contrast with the black background and a singular yellow was included to complement the purples used.
- Glass morphism was used for the backgrounds to text to create a break from the moving background and increase readability and further reduce any distractibility that could come with the use of the tsparticles background.
- White text was used throughout the site for consistency and to contrast against the black background to improve readability.
- Framer Motion was used to make it so pages faded in and out more elegantly rather than having components immediately come in and out on button presses.
