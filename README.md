# Sapphy Doyle Profile Site

## About

This is a website made for Sapphy Doyle, a young professional currently seeking employment.
I spoke to Sapphy and decided to work along side her coming up with a design for a profile site which would help her stand out to potential employers in her job search.
As this is being made for free I had one condition which was that I was allowed to use any technology I wanted and I've learned a fair amount of React through online resources, but haven't had much experience with it I decided to use React along with React BootStrap and TsParticles to take care of the presentation and layout respectively.

The Home page of the site allows for users to download Sapphy's rÃ©sumÃ©. As of the moment the site is still using placeholder text and images while Sapphy gets the relevant items to be used throughout the site.
