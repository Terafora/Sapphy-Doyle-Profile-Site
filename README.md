# Sapphy Doyle Profile Site

## About

This is a website made for Sapphy Doyle, a young professional currently seeking employment.
I spoke to Sapphy and decided to work along side her coming up with a design for a profile site which would help her stand out to potential employers in her job search.
As this is being made for free I had one condition which was that I was allowed to use any technology I wanted and I've learned a fair amount of React through online resources, but haven't had much experience with it I decided to use React along with React BootStrap and TsParticles to take care of the presentation and layout respectively.
